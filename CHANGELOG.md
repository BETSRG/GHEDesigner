# GHEDT - History of changes
 
## Current version

### New features

* [Issue 3](https://github.com/j-c-cook/GLHEDT/issues/3) - Adds a GHE object with the ability to simulate and size with a hybrid time step using information found by the peak load analysis tool.
* [Issue 8](https://github.com/j-c-cook/GLHEDT/issues/8) - Adds a detailed hourly simulation so that the hybrid time step can be validated. 
* [Issue 9](https://github.com/j-c-cook/ghedt/issues/11) - A function that computes a live g-function using `pygfunction` is created. The functions default arguments are unequal segments, the equivalent solver and the mixed inlet fluid temperature boundary condition.
