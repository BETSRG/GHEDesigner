# GHEDesigner - A Flexible and Automatic Ground Heat Exchanger Design Tool

GHEDesigner is a Python package for designing ground heat exchangers (GHE) used with ground source heat pump (GSHP)
systems. Compared to currently available tools such
as [GLHEPRO](https://betsrg.org/ground-loop-heat-exchanger-design-software), GHEDesigner:

- is flexible. It can synthesize borehole fields that are custom fit to the user's property description,
- implements the RowWise algorithm ([Spitler, et al. 2022a](https://doi.org/10.22488/okstate.22.000016)) for
  automatically placing and sizing boreholes in any land area with complex geometry,
- is highly automated. It can select library configurations or custom configurations and determine the final number and
  depth requirement of boreholes,
- can make automated conversion of hourly loads to an improved hybrid time step
  representation ([Cullin and Spitler 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geothermics.2011.01.001)), and
- is under continuing development at Oklahoma State University (OSU), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), and the
  National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). (GLHEPRO remains under development at OSU.)

## Background

GHEDesigner was originally funded through US Department of Energy contract DE‐AC05‐00OR22725 via a subcontract from Oak
Ridge National Laboratory. The project led by Dr. Xiaobing Liu developed an
online [screening tool](https://gshp.ornl.gov/login) ([Liu, et al. 2022](http://dx.doi.org/10.22488/okstate.22.000042))
for techno-economic analysis and design of ground-source heat pump systems. The Oklahoma State University team led by
Prof. Jeffrey D. Spitler was contracted to investigate fast methods for computing g-functions. An outgrowth of this
research was a tool for automatically selecting and sizing borehole configurations. This tool, originally called GHEDT,
is described in an MS thesis ([Cook 2021](https://hdl.handle.net/11244/335489)). Since that time, the tool has been
renamed GHEDesigner, and work has continued at Oklahoma State University, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and the
National Renewable Energy Laboratory.

Updates since [Cook (2021)](https://hdl.handle.net/11244/335489) include:

- Development and addition of RowWise algorithm to efficiently place boreholes in the available land area.
- Extensive refactoring for creating a user-focused, stable API.
- Simplification of library dependencies.
- Development of automated testing and deployment procedures.

## Borehole Field Design Algorithms

- Long time-step g-functions are calculated using pygfunction (Cimmino 2018) using the equivalent borehole
  method ([Prieto and Cimmino 2021](https://doi.org/10.1080/19401493.2021.1968953)). It's also possible to read
  g-functions from a library ([Spitler, et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.15121/1811518)).
- Borehole thermal resistance is computed for single and double U-tube configurations via the multipole
  method ([Claesson and Hellström 2011](https://doi.org/10.1080/10789669.2011.609927)). For coaxial ground heat
  exchangers, it is computed from fundamental heat transfer relationships.
- Short time-step g-functions are computed using the
  [Xu and Spitler (2006)](https://hvac.okstate.edu/sites/default/files/pubs/papers/2006/07-Xu_Spitler_06.pdf) method.
- GHEDesigner contains a novel design methodology for automated selection of borehole fields. The advanced methodology
  performs optimization based on a target drilling depth. An integer bisection routine is utilized to quickly search
  over a uni-modal domain of boreholes. GHEDesigner can consider the available land area for drilling and no-drilling
  zones defined as polygons.
- GHEDesigner can synthesize a range of regularly shaped borehole configurations, including previously available
  shapes (rectangles, open rectangles, L-shape, U-shape, line) and shapes not previously available (C-shapes and zoned
  rectangles). More information about these shapes can be found in the documentation for a publicly available g-function
  library. ([Spitler, et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.15121/1811518), \
  [2022b](https://doi.org/10.22488/okstate.22.000040))
- GHEDesigner can synthesize on the fly irregularly shaped borehole configurations using the RowWise
  algorithm ([Spitler, et al. 2022a](https://doi.org/10.22488/okstate.22.000016)) or the bi-uniform polygonal constrained
  rectangular search (BUPCRS) ([Cook 2021](https://hdl.handle.net/11244/335489)). Both configurations are adapted to the
  user-specified property boundaries and no-drill zones, if any. [Spitler, et al. 2022a](https://doi.org/10.22488/okstate.22.000016)
  gives an example where the RowWise algorithm saves 12-18% compared to the BUPCRS algorithm. The RowWise algorithm takes
  longer to run, though.
- A set of search routines can be used to size different types of configurations:
    - The unconstrained square/near-square search will search a domain of square (*n* x *n*) and near-square
      (*n-1* x *n*) boreholes fields, with uniform spacing between the boreholes.
    - Uniform and bi-uniform constrained rectangular searches will search domains of rectangular configurations that
      have either uniform spacing or "bi-uniform" spacing – that is, uniform in the x direction and uniform in the y
      direction, but the two spacings may be different.
    - The bi-uniform constrained zoned rectangular search allows for rectangular configurations with different interior
      and perimeter spacings.
    - The bi-uniform polygonal constrained rectangular search (BUPCRS) can search configurations with an outer perimeter
      and no-go zones described as irregular polygons. This is still referred to as a rectangular search because it is
      still based on a rectangular grid, from which boreholes that are outside the perimeter or inside a no-go zone are
      removed.
    - The RowWise method generates and searches custom borehole fields that make full use of the available property. The
      RowWise algorithms are described by [Spitler et al. (2022a)](https://shareok.org/handle/11244/336846).

## Limitations

GHEDesigner does not have every feature that is found in a tool like GLHEPRO. Features that are currently missing
include:

- Heat pumps are not modeled. Users input heat rejection/extraction rates.
- An hourly simulation is available, but it doesn't make use of load aggregation, so is very slow.
- GHEDesigner only covers vertical borehole ground heat exchangers. Horizontal ground heat exchangers are not treated.
- GHEDesigner does not calculate the head loss in the ground heat exchanger or warn the user that head loss may be
  excessive.
- GHEDesigner does not have a graphical user interface.
- GHEDesigner is a Python package and requires some Python knowledge to use.
