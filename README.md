# Ground Heat Exchanger Design Toolbox

The Ground Heat Exchanger Design Toolbox (GHEDT) is a Python package that 
provides the tools necessary to quantify the short and long-term thermal 
interaction in a GHE. GHEDT can predict heat pump entering fluid temperatures 
for design over the design life. It can determine the required borehole depth 
of a specified borehole field to ensure the heat pump entering fluid temperature 
remains within specified bounds. GHEDT is novel in its ability to select a 
borehole field layout based on a target depth.
